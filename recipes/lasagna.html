  <h2>Mom's Lasagna recepie</h2>
  <p>Filling and easy to make, lasagnas are great one-dish meals that check all the boxes, as they can be filled with all sorts of veggies, sauces, and proteins, and can be adjusted to many special dietary needs. Our red and white sauce lasagna is a flavorful combination of a basic white sauce, rather than ricotta cheese, and a tomato-based sauce with beef and pork that's flavored with spices and mushrooms. Covered in cheese and baked until golden, this is a great weeknight meal served with a simple salad and crusty bread.</p>
  <ul><h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>1 package oven-ready lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <ol><h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 F. In a 3-quart ovenproof baking dish, ladle enough of the red meat sauce to cover the bottom of the baking dish.</li>
    <li>Arrange a layer of pasta atop the red meat sauce and then another layer of red sauce.</li>
    <li>Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake for 40 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
