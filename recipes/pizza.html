  <h2>Amazing Homemade Pizza</h2>
  <p>My kids love pizza, so pepperoni pizza is usually a surefire dinner win. But if I'm being honest, I rarely make pizza for my kids. I view pizza as a cheat night for me, and I get delivery.

So when I decided to make pizza at home, I knew it needed to be better than your average delivery. It needed tons of pepperoni, a nice crust, great flavor, and maybe even a surprise or two to put it over the top.</p>
<ul><h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <li>16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade (I like this no-knead version, though note that this recipe makes enough dough for 2 pizzas)</li>
  <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce (see below)
  </li>
  <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
</ul>
<ol><h2>recepie</h2>
  <li>Make the sauce</li>
  <li>Add the toppings</li>
  <li>Cook the pizza</li>

</ol>
